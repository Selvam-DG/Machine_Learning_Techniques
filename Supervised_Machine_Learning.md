# Supervised Machine Learning
1. Regression
2. Classification

- Three Phases 
  - Geometrical Intution
  - Probabilistic Aprroach
  - Log-Loss function

- If Dataset D(Xi,Yi)contain one independent and one dependent variables, then it is simple linear Regression
- If Dataset contaim  more than one independent variables and one dependent variable, then it is multiple linear regression
- If depenent variable is continous variable of Real number with n-dimension
- If dependent varaible is (0,1), then it is classification  Problem (eg: yes/no, True/ False, Buy/Not Buy......)
- If dependent variable is in range of(0,9), then it multi-class classification problem (eg. Rating the product, 
- if dependent variable is belongs to Real number with n dimension, then it is regression
