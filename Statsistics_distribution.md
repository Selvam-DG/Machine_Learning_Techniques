## Discrete Distributions:
 - The sum of all individual probabilities must be equal to one
 - Bernoulis distribution, Binomial distribution, uniform distribution
## Continuous Distribution:
 - The area under the probability curve must be equal to one
 - Normal distribution

### Binomial Distribution:
- Random variables can have only two outcomes  - success/failure or Yes/No
- n random variables
- if n = 1, then binomial distribution is Bernoulli distribution
- The objective is to find the probability of getting k-success out of n trails (k<=n)
- trials should be made up independently
- if the probability of success is p then the probability of failure is 1-p
- If random variables is a Binomial variables, then
   - The trails are independent
   - each trial has either success or failure outcome
   - fixed number of trails
   - the probability of success should be constant
- **Bernoulli distribution**”: One trial or experiment with outcome “success” or “failure”
- ”**Binomial distribution**”: n independent trials, each with outcome “success” or “failure”

### Poisson Distribution:
- we can prefer Poisson distribution, whenever a number of events have to be calculated in a fixed interval of time with a known mean or average rate and independently of the time
