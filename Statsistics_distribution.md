### Binomial distribution:
- Random variables can have only two outcomes  - success/failure or Yes/No
- n random varaibles
- if n = 1, then binomial distribution is Bernoullis distribution
- The objective is to find the probability of getting k-success out of n trails (k<=n)
- trials should be made up independentally
- if probability of success is p then the probability of failure is 1-p
- If random variables is a Binomial varaible, then
   - The trails are independent
   - each trail has either success or failure outcome
   - fixed number of trails
   - probability of success should be constant
