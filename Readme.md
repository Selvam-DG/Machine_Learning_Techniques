### Re-inforced Machine Learning
### Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

# Regression
-  Dependent and Independent variable
- Dependent varibles is a continuous changable varibale, then the model comes under Regression
- Algorithms
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Support Vector Machine Regressor
  - K - Nearest Neighbour KNN Regressor
  - Ensemble Learning Regressor

# Classification
- Binary/Multiclass/Categorical/Dichotomous problem
- the problem having a solution of yes or no / True or False/ 0 or 1 -  those problems comes under Classification problem
- Algorithms:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine Classifier
     - Kernel => Linear/ Sigmoid/ Polynomial / Radial Basial Function
   - K Nearest Neighbour KNN => Naive Base Theorem
   - Ensemble Learning
