# Machine Learning
## Supervised Machine Learning
- Regression
- Classification
### Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Clustering / Segmentation / Grouping
- Recommendation Engine/ Market Basket Analysis
### Re-inforced Machine Learning
- Penalty
- Reward
### Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

- Supervised ML methods have Independent and Dependent Variables. Split the data into train and test and then predict the values with test data with actual data
- Unsupervised ML methods have only an independent variable (NO target variable) and no data splitting

# Regression
-  Dependent and Independent variable
- Dependent variables is a continuous changeable variable, then the model comes under Regression
- Algorithms
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Support Vector Machine Regressor
  - K - Nearest Neighbour KNN Regressor
  - Ensemble Learning Regressor

# Classification
- Binary/Multiclass/Categorical/Dichotomous problem
- the problem having a solution of yes or no / True or False/ 0 or 1 -  those problems come under Classification problem
- Algorithms:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine Classifier
     - Kernel => Linear/ Sigmoid/ Polynomial / Radial Basial Function
   - K Nearest Neighbour KNN => Naive Base Theorem
   - Ensemble Learning
 
### Ensemble learning
- Support both Regression and classification problem
- 4 types of Ensemble
  - Bagging
    - Bagging
    - Random Forest
  - Boosting
     - Ada Boost
     - Gradient Boosting
     - XG Boosting
     - Light GBM Boosting
     - Cat Boosting
  - Stacking
  - Cascading
