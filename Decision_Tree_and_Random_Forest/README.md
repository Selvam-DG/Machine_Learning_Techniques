## Decision Tree
- Supervised Machine Learning algorithm
- Classification Tree
- Regression Tree
- Discreter and continuous dependent variable
- If outcome/ dependent variable is discrete, then it is classification tree
- If outcome variable is continuous, then it is Regression tree
- Geomtrical intitution in Decision Tree algorithm is **Axis Parallel Hyperplane**
- Decision Tree is simply a nested if-else condition
