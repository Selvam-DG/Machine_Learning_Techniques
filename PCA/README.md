# Pricipal Component Ananlysis (PCA)
- This is dimensionality reduction method
- This method is applicable for both supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning
- If we have a huge data set or many variables are there in the dataset, we use dimensionality reduction
  - The reduction may be variables( columns) or values that are non-significant to the dataset
  - The reduction handles multicollinearity by removing redundant features, handle missing values, outliers
  - This reduction is not target to non-significant variables, we can target particular value
 
- PCA takes less tunning and computational time
