# Pricipal Component Analysis (PCA)
- This is the dimensionality reduction method
- This method is applicable for both supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning
- If we have a huge data set or many variables are there in the dataset, we use dimensionality reduction
  - The reduction may be variables( columns) or values that are non-significant to the dataset
  - The reduction handles multicollinearity by removing redundant features, handling missing values, outliers
  - This reduction is not targeted to non-significant variables, we can target particular value
 
- PCA takes less tunning and computational time
### Eigen Values and Eigen Vector
- This eigenvalue and eigenvector concept is used in several ML models and algorithm
  - PCA
  - Factor Analysis
  - Reinforcement Learning
